understand what a mute person is trying to express. These kind of people cannot spend normal life. They face a lot 
communication issues at every point. Also they get certain boundaries and limitations to their goals and professional aims. Hence they get demotivated and Inferiority Complex. 
A Sign Language Interpreter is
needed for such type of people to ease their life.
